# Project Overview 

## project :
     Optimization Model Using Linear Programming

## Objective
To maximize the total profit for a manufacturing company that produces two products (Product A and Product B) within limited production time constraints. The task is solved using Linear Programming (LP) to determine the optimal number of units to produce for each product.

## Key Activities
### 1.Problem Formulation

* Defined decision variables:

* x = units of Product A

* y = units of Product B

* Formulated the objective function to maximize profit:
Maximize: 30x + 20y

### 2.Defined Constraints

* Time limit constraint:
2x + 1y â‰¤ 12 (total 12 production hours)

* Non-negativity constraint:
x â‰¥ 0, y â‰¥ 0

### 3.Model Implementation

* Used the PuLP library to build and solve the Linear Programming model.

### 4.Solution Output

* Computed the optimal number of units to produce for each product.

* Obtained maximum profit and interpreted the result.

### 5.Insights & Interpretation

* Concluded that producing 6 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B yields the highest profit (â‚¹180).

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
* **Programming Language**: Python

* **Libraries**:

* PuLP â€“ for linear programming optimization

* Matplotlib â€“ (optional for visualization)

* Jupyter Notebook â€“ for execution and explanation

## Platform Execution
* **Development Platform**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)


## Conclusion
This project showcases how Linear Programming can be applied to solve real-world business optimization problems. By modeling production limits and profit constraints, the company can make data-driven decisions to maximize profit. The approach is scalable and can be adjusted if business parameters change, making it a valuable tool in operations research and resource planning.
